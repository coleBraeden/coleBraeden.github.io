        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>A tool exists in the world right now which many companies are beginning to utilize that has the power to completely revolutionize the economy and anyone with a computer has access to it. It’s a tool that can save lives by detecting health problems early, it can drive your car for you, and it’s abilities allow for the creation of things once impossible. This tool is known as machine learning and it’s making our computers more closely related to us than ever. Throughout this paper, it will be made clear what machine learning is, what it can do, and how it’s going to affect the future.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-machine-learning">What is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>Machine learning doesn’t have a simple definition, it’s a complex multifaceted tool that utilizes difficult math, data manipulation, and programming. Michael Megliola is a programmer who uses machine learning in his day to day job to find trends in financial markets for companies. According to Michael “Machine learning combines trial-and-error, math, and computer science to solve problems dynamically. Instead of coding a solution to a specific problem, you apply a general method of solving problems, then use both random chance and math to find your way toward a solution” (Megliola). Machine learning is a general method of solving problems, it’s a tool, and it uses random chance in a similar way to how creatures evolve. A program utilizing machine learning first starts not working at all but slowly adapts over time to perform a task better and better every iteration. There are many different methods of machine learning but they all generally utilize random chance to “mutate” and if that “mutation” benefits the program’s ability to perform its task it’ll keep that “mutation”. The program will keep “mutating” until it’s either able to complete its task to the best of its ability or is stopped manually. Christopher Bishop’s Model-Based Machine Learning explains that these programs are composed of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer (Bishop). The input layer and output layer are generally easy to understand. An input layer could be something like a Google search and the output layer could be the results of the internet for relevant websites. The input layer could be an image and the output layer could be what objects and actions are in the image. The input layer could be a picture of a gorilla and the output layer could be how much the gorilla weighs. The possibilities are endless, but how is this possible? Michael Megliola explained “We can reduce very large data sets into meaningful trends or relationships without an explicit understanding, in advance, of cause and effect” (Megliola). The advantage of machine learning is that any accurate dataset with relevant trends can be turned into an algorithm. Even trends like how something appears compared to how much it weighs. In Michael’s case, he uses pre existing financial market information to accurately predict how it’s going to trend in the future. Predicting the future is one of the many things that this miraculous tool is capable of but it’s being used for so much more.</p>

        <h2 id="what-can-it-do">What can it do?</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is incredibly relevant to the lives of everyone and already impacts the lives of many people every day. According to Michael ”Some tasks, like reading x-rays, can be conducted at scale to save lives; other tasks, like surveillance, can intrude on people's personal liberties.” (Megliola). Machine learning in the medical industry already is capable of detecting areas of concern in x-rays and colonoscopies with even higher accuracy than professional doctors. Some technological firms are using machine learning to identify people in images or videos. In China, this technology has even been used to detect people’s race in what may be the future of racial discrimination.  In Model-Based Machine Learning, it’s explained that machine learning has had a lasting impact in the fields of web searching, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and speech recognition (Bishop). The biggest advances in web searching technology are thanks to machine learning. Thanks to machine learning search results are extraordinarily relevant to what was searched. One of the best examples of this progression would be Google Images search results. This allows you to look up for example “orange vest”, “person wearing an orange vest”, and “person wearing an orange vest airstrip” each time with relevant results regardless of how vague or specific the search is. In the article What Can Machine Learning Do? Workforce Implications It's explained that Machine learning is a “general purpose” technology much like the steam engine or electricity, and it’s capable of being applied to virtually every job (Brynjolfsson, Erik, Tom Mitchell). Since machine learning is applicable towards nearly every job it’s likely to somehow impact nearly everyone’s life. Learning more about machine learning today is important since it’s likely to change every person's life for better or worse. The more people are educated on machine learning the better they can make an informed decision on how this technology is used and how it should be restricted. Thankfully machine learning isn’t the only thing that can predict the future, people can too, and the future of a world with machine learning isn’t as bad as it may seem. </p>

        <h2 id="future">What does the future hold?</h2>
        <p>How is machine learning going to impact the future? Will everyone lose their jobs to machines? Will machine learning create jobs? Will machine learning even be a part of our future? According to Machine Learning automation isn’t going to take over the majority of jobs, in some cases, it will enhance aspects of jobs. The occasional jobs it does replace, the article argues, will drive down the costs of products or services so that consumer savings can be spent elsewhere reviving demand for labor (Dellot, Benedict, Brhmie Balaram). As it turns out people shouldn’t be so worried about job losses due to automation, in fact, many of the jobs it replaces such as the jobs of truck drivers would significantly decrease the cost products since it cuts the labor costs for shipping a product. The article The Jobs That Artificial Intelligence Will Create explains how artificial intelligence will create three types of jobs: trainers, explainers, and sustainers (Wilson, H. James). Trainers create AI and train them; explainers determine what kind of AI should be deployed and where; sustainers evaluate the impact of AI and promote better AI methods (Wilson, H. James). The article goes on to explain how these jobs are unprecedented and will be required at scale across many industries (Wilson, H. James). It explains further how many jobs will be unspecialized, something extraordinarily important since it means people who lost their jobs due to artificial intelligence will have a number of new jobs to replace their job without any extra education (Wilson, H. James). In the article Building Trust in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Robotics it talks about how trust in artificial intelligence is important for the continued research and implementation of artificial intelligence (Siau, Keng, Weiyu Wang). Trust can define the way people interact with technology (Siau, Keng, Weiyu Wang). Trust is typically gradually built up requiring two-way interactions however in the case of objects/technology a person can decide whether they trust something before having any first-hand experience with it (Siau, Keng, Weiyu Wang). There are two major factors that play in building initial trust in AI performance and process (Siau, Keng, Weiyu Wang). In order for AI to have a good performance, it has to have a good representation, public image, and good reviews (Siau, Keng, Weiyu Wang). To have a good process it has to be easily explainable and come off as transparent to people (Siau, Keng, Weiyu Wang). In order for people to build continuous trust in AI, it has to have a good performance being usable/reliable, easily interoperable, secure, and preferably promote sociability and bonding (Siau, Keng, Weiyu Wang). It also needs to have a good process, being able to replace jobs or some aspects of jobs (Siau, Keng, Weiyu Wang). Without trust in artificial intelligence, it’s likely that it will have some difficulty becoming a closer aspect of people’s lives. Machine learning is capable of improving our lives, jobs, and health but if we don’t have any trust in machine learning it’s not going to have much of a role in our lives at all.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>It should now be clear what machine learning is, what it’s capable of, and how it’s going to impact the future. Machine learning is a general-purpose tool that’s able to reduce large datasets into algorithms capable of predicting trends. Machine learning can either improve lives through improved medical technology, improved products, and improved jobs or it could be used for mass-scale surveillance and systematic oppression. If machine learning is trusted by the public it’s likely that it’ll struggle to become a part of people’s lives. Machine learning is very powerful, it’s versatile, and it will change everyone’s life forever.</p>

        <h3>Neurological Networks</h3>
        <p>Neural networks are created with an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. Depending on the complexity of the problem the hidden layer can be adjusted to include more nodes. These nodes are like the synapses in our brains, the more there are the more complex a problem can be however this is at the cost of increased computation and it typically takes more time to train.</p>

        <h3>Accuracy and Loss</h3>
        <p>With machine learning a program won’t function accurately unless it’s been trained for a while. The x-axis represents the “generation” of the program. It takes about fifty generations before the algorithm is reasonably accurate. The loss function calculates how much it “costs” to do something, the program tries to minimize this value while maximizing accuracy.</p>
